# ✅ Test Plan & Evaluation

## 📌 User Stories Tested

### 🧩 User Story 1 – Hamburger Menu Toggle

> As a user, I want to click a hamburger menu to show or hide the navigation menu.

### 🧩 User Story 2 – Modal Open/Close

> As a user, I want to open and close a modal window so I can interact with dynamic content.

## 🧪 System Tests

| User Story | Scenario         | ✅ Happy Path (Expected Behavior)                       | ❌ Unhappy Path (Error Handling)                       |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Toggle menu      | Menu toggles visibility when clicked (`.active` class) | Missing element logs error, function exits gracefully |
| 2          | Modal open/close | Modal shows/hides via `display: block`/`none`          | Missing modal/button logs error without crashing      |

## 🧩 Unit Tests

### User Story 1 – Hamburger Menu

* `toggleMenu()` correctly toggles the `.active` class.
* Gracefully returns if the element is missing.

### User Story 2 – Modal Handling

* `openModal()` sets `modal.style.display = 'block'`.
* `closeModal()` sets `modal.style.display = 'none'`.
* Returns `null` if required elements are not found.

## 🧠 Evaluation

### ✅ Detectable Error

* If one or more DOM elements are missing (e.g., menu or modal), the script logs a helpful error and avoids crashing.
* Example:

  ```
  console.error: Required DOM elements are missing
  ```

### ❌ Undetectable Error

* Visual bugs such as:

  * Modal hidden due to CSS (`z-index`, `opacity`)
  * Misalignment or off-screen placement
  * Animations not triggering
* These cannot be detected by logic-only tests and require manual/visual testing.

---

## 📈 Can We Say "Everything Works"?

### ✔️ Yes, for logic:

* All JavaScript functionalities (toggling, showing/hiding) behave as expected.
* Edge cases (missing DOM nodes) are handled.

### ❗ Not fully, because:

* CSS styles, layout, responsiveness, and accessibility are **not tested**.
* Cross-browser behavior is not validated.

**🧾 Conclusion:**

> The application logic is well-tested and stable. Visual styling and UX must still be validated manually or with visual regression tools.
